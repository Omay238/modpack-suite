# Mod Suite
A group of 3 Minecraft modpacks for Vanilla

## Modpack 1
First modpack in the series, pure optimization, fastest and least featureful of the bunch

## Modpack 2
Second modpack. Acts as an Optifine replacement, with few extra features.

## Modpack 3
Third modpack. Similar to modpack 3, is still unintrusive, but with a couple more QOL features.

## Modpack 4
Fourth modpack. Vanilla overhaul with many more features, from Xaero's minimap to EMI, a JEI replacement.
